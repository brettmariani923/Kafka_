the project has 5 main components:


ProducerApp (writes data) →

purchases topic (raw event stream) →

PurchaseProcessorApp (consumes, validates, republishes) →

analytics topic (clean/processed stream) →

AnalyticsConsumerApp (final consumer: stores, analyzes, displays).



1. ProducerApp → purchases

ProducerApp is your event generator. In the code, it’s creating PurchaseEvent objects (user, item, timestamp).

Each event is published to the Kafka topic named purchases.

Think of the purchases topic as a durable, ordered log where all purchase events go.

2. purchases → PurchaseProcessorApp

PurchaseProcessorApp is a Kafka consumer application.

It subscribes to the purchases topic.

For every purchase event it reads, it:

Validates/enriches the data (e.g., check formatting, add metadata).

Produces a new event (if valid) to another Kafka topic, analytics.

So it’s acting as a middleman/processor: consuming from one topic, producing to another.

3. analytics → AnalyticsConsumerApp

AnalyticsConsumerApp is another consumer application.

It subscribes to the analytics topic.

Here you might:

Aggregate statistics (total items sold, most popular product).

Store data in a database or dashboard.

Power real-time analytics or monitoring systems.

So to put it together

ProducerApp (writes data) →

purchases topic (raw event stream) →

PurchaseProcessorApp (consumes, validates, republishes) →

analytics topic (clean/processed stream) →

AnalyticsConsumerApp (final consumer: stores, analyzes, displays).
