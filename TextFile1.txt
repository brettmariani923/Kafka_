Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It was originally developed by LinkedIn, and later open-sourced as part of the Apache Software Foundation. 
Kafka is widely used in various industries for applications such as log aggregation, real-time analytics, event sourcing, and stream processin.
Some common companies that most people are familiar with and that use the technology are twitter, netflix, uber, etc.

Kafka works on a publish-subscribe model, where producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to those topics to receive the messages 
For example, if I need an uber, my request gets published as a message and gets sent to the correct topic/partition, and then available drivers in my area can see and accept my request).


It is designed to handle high throughput and low latency,

High thoroughput meanign: 

The system can process a large volume of data or requests per unit of time.

Think of it as: How much work can be done in a second/minute/hour?

Example: A Kafka cluster handling millions of messages per second.



and low latency, 

Meaning: The system responds very quickly to each individual request.

Think of it as: How fast does a single message/request travel from start to finish?

Example: Sending a message through Kafka and having a consumer receive it in a few milliseconds.


Imagine a highway:

High throughput = many lanes, thousands of cars move per minute.

Low latency = each car moves quickly with minimal delay from entrance to exit.

A system can have:

High throughput but higher latency (e.g., a batch process moving tons of data but not instantly).

Low latency but lower throughput (e.g., a quick but narrow pipe).

The best systems (like Kafka) aim for both: process lots of data (throughput) while keeping individual message delays small (latency).


Because kafka has high throughput and low latency, its a good fit for processing large volumes of data in real-time.

Kafka stores messages in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner across multiple brokers, ensuring high availability and durability of data.
